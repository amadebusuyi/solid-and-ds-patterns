// Command - interface declaring the execution method
// ConcreteCommandA - encapsulates a request and defines binding between Receiver and action
// ConcreteCommandB - another concrete command with different behavior
// Receiver - the object that performs the actual work
// Sender/Invoker - stores and executes commands
// Client - creates concrete commands and assigns them to the invoker

/**
*****Command Pattern Components******
 * 1. Command - interface defining an execute() method
 * 2. ConcreteCommandA - implements Command, delegates work to a specific Receiver
 * 3. ConcreteCommandB - another Command implementation
 * 4. Receiver - knows how to perform the actual operation
 * 5. Invoker - triggers the command without knowing how itâ€™s executed
 * 6. Client - creates commands, configures the invoker with them
**/

/**
*****Use Cases******
 * 1. Undo/redo systems in applications
 * 2. Task scheduling or job queues
 * 3. GUI buttons or menu actions that trigger encapsulated commands
 * 4. Macro recording and playback
 * 5. Remote controls for devices (mapping buttons to actions dynamically)
